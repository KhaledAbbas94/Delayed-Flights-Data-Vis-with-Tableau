# Flight Delays and Cancellations Data Visualization Project

This repository contains the work I completed for the Flight Delays and Cancellations Data Visualization project during my Udacity Tableau Nanodegree. The project involved exploring and analyzing a real dataset from Kaggle, focusing on the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. The primary goal was to create insightful data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data.



## Dataset
The main dataset used for this project is `flights.csv`, obtained from Kaggle. It tracks various aspects of flight performance, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of delays and cancellations.

## Visualizations
I have created multiple dashboards and visualizations using Tableau to address specific questions and showcase the insights derived from the data. The PDF file in this repository, titled `Data_Visualization_in_Tableau-Flights.pdf`, contains a detailed presentation of these visualizations.



### Key Questions Explored:
1. **Airlines and Airports with the Worst Delays:**
   - Identification of airlines and airports with the highest delays.
   - Alternative visualizations employed to effectively communicate delay patterns.

2. **Destinations and Arrival Destinations with the Most Delays:**
   - Analysis of delays based on departure and arrival destinations.
   - Utilization of appropriate visualizations to convey information effectively.

3. **Causes of Delays:**
   - Investigation into the factors causing delays during flights.
   - Consideration of variations in delay causes across airports and time of year.




## How to Access the Visualizations
To explore the detailed visualizations and gain insights from the project, please refer to the [`Data_Visualization_in_Tableau-Flights.pdf`](/Data_Visualization_in_Tableau-Flights.pdf) file in this repository. Each page in the PDF corresponds to a specific dashboard or set of visualizations addressing different aspects of the dataset.
